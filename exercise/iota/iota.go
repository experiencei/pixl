//--Summary:
//  Create a calculator that can perform basic mathematical operations.
//
//--Requirements:
//* Mathematical operations must be defined as constants using iota
//* Write a receiver function that performs the mathematical operation
//  on two operands
//* Operations required:
//  - Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide
//* The existing function calls in main() represent the API and cannot be changed
//
//--Notes:
//* Your program is complete when it compiles and prints the correct results

package main

import "fmt"

//* Mathematical operations must be defined as constants using iota
const (
	Add = iota
	Subtract
	Multiply
	Divide
)
